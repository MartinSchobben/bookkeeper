Description: Bookkeeper is meant to provide a convenient solution for bookkeeping and administration in R. It provides features to create and store invoices, maintain daybooks for e.g., sales and purchases, and a customer data base. In the end, this managing of files can be used to generate a general ledger and an income statement. However, these features are still under development.
